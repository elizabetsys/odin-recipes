# odin-recipes

This is my HTML Foundations Project: Recipes.
I will be demonstrating the skills I have learned in writing HTML.
I'll be making ordered and unordered lists.
Creating absolute and relative links to webpages and images.
It's not going to be pretty because I haven't learned how to use CSS or JavaScript yet.
